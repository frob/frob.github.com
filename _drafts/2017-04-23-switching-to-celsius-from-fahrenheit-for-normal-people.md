TLDR;

For the vast majority of people who would be switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, this is what you need to know.

|    Celsius     | Action to take                                                                                                 |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Below 0 °C   | It is frozen wear a jacket and possibly themals. The further below 0 °C the more warm cloths you need to wear. |
| 0 °C to 10 °C  | Its cold, but not freezing. Wear a jacket.                                                                     |
| 10 °C to 20 °C | There is a chill, a shirt is fine if you're into colder weather.                                               |
| 20 °C to 25 °C | The temperature is ideal for human beings.                                                                     |
| 25 °C to 30 °C | It is warm but not hot.                                                                                        |
| 30 °C to 40 °C | It is hot, unless necessary don't go outside or in the sun.                                                    |
|   over 40 °C   | These places exist on earth, but I have no idea why anyone would live there.                                   |
