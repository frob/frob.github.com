TLDR;

For the vast majority of people who would be switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, this is what you need to know.

|    Celsius     | Action to take                                                                                                 |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Below 0 °C   | It is frozen wear a jacket and possibly themals. The further below 0 °C the more warm cloths you need to wear. |
| 0 °C to 10 °C  | Its cold, but not freezing. Wear a jacket.                                                                     |
| 10 °C to 20 °C | There is a chill, a shirt is fine if you're into colder weather.                                               |
| 20 °C to 25 °C | The temperature is ideal for human beings.                                                                     |
| 25 °C to 30 °C | It is warm but not hot.                                                                                        |
| 30 °C to 40 °C | It is hot, unless necessary don't go outside or in the sun.                                                    |
|   over 40 °C   | These places exist on earth, but I have no idea why anyone would live there.                                   |

## What is Fahrenheit

Fahrenheit was a scale that (to the best of our knowlege) was derived by 0 being a solution of equal parts water and salt, and the temprature of a health human being 96. In the final standard of the scale the healthy human ended up being 98.6 and freezing water at sea level was 32.

In short, this was a scale created in 1724 based on some faulty assumptions.

## What is Celsius

Celsius (also called centigrade) is a scale of temprature that is based on water at sea level. 100 degrees Celsius is boiling and 0 degrees Celsius is freezing. If you would like more information on Celcius, read the [wikipedia article on Celcius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius). 

Celcius when under some revisions and refinement as the scale centigrade, but in 1948 it was officially renamed Celcius to honur the person who originally thought of it in 1742.

## Why switch

Conformity is a good argument, but it isn't the argument I would use for this. I would say the reason to switch is because it makes more sense and it is easier to see wither or not it is comfortable outside. Refer to the table at the begining. If it's over 30, it's too hot.

## Fahrenheit to Celsius Math conversion

This convertion is why I say, just switch outright. Don't worry about converting. Nearly everything that tells you the temprature can be set to the unit of your choice. If you want to convert do this [°C] = ([°F] − 32) ×  5⁄9

Or don't bother converting. Refer to the following table.
