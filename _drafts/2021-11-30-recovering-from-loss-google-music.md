## Google Music

## The aftermath

## Getting your Music back into shape

### The problem

### Similarity

#### How I fixed it

```bash
$ find . -name "*.mp3" | wc -l
   12089
```

```bash
find . -name "*([0-9][0-9][0-9]).mp3" -delete
```

```bash
$ find . -name "*.mp3" | wc -l
   5896
```

#### Do as I say not as I did

Don't try to do it all in one pass. You will fail and you will loose all your work.
