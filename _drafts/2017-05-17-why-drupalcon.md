# Collaboration and Contribution at DrupalCon

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) is the most flexible general purpose Content Management System on the market today --Open Source or not. Using Drupal allows us to provide a cost effective and flexible platform for our clients. Contributing to Drupal allows us to ensure it remains the best and most flexible general purpose Content Management System.

Contributing to Drupal is the job of the Drupal Community.

## What is Drupal Con?

[Drupal Con](https://events.drupal.org) is a conference where the Drupal Community can meet each other and exchange information in real life. Historically, the North American Drupal Con will bounce around the Continental US, but Drupal Con also happens in Europe, Asia, and South America.

The conference spans multiple days starting with paid training. Throughout the week there are community contributed sessions, and a vendor exposition hall. It all ends with community driven project sprints.

## Why go to Drupal Con?

At its core Drupal Con is a technology conference, so a big part of going to Drupal Con is keeping up with the current trends in technology. Not just in the Drupal Project but also trends within the php programming language and technology as a whole.

Hallway conversations are a great way to keep up with current trends. I missed quite a few session while hanging out in the halls talking to people. This isn't a big deal because the Drupal Association records and posts all the sessions on youtube --usually within a day or two. The point of attending the conference is the people.

### Keeping up with Technology

Over the years, the Drupal Community created many [powerful tools to help support Drupal Development](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools). These tools solved common problems but were built specifically for Drupal. With the release of Drupal 8, many of those tools have been replaced by their best-in-class equivalents from the php development community.

All of the [Drupal Con sessions are posted to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpeDXSh4nHjRbDdwHEBRHItfnjrJ8kEDK) by the association and much of their information can be learned from reading blog posts online, attending local DUGs (Drupal User Groups), or [conversations on Drupal's IRC channels](https://www.drupal.org/irc), but it's important to get fully immersed by congregating for a few days with community members that are not local.

### Open Source Contribution

A large part of getting together is working together. Much of the work on an open source project happens remotely. This is difficult with many core maintainers being spread all over the globe in different timezones. At Drupal Con we have the remarkable ability to be in the same room. This allows for many opportunities for collaboration. Code sprints go on all week with Friday being reserved as a sprint day. There are no sessions or talks on Friday, leaving the whole day for contribution.

The way this works is they have one or more rooms with round tables, generally the tables will be organized into topics: migration, twig, install-system, etc. This is also a good place to work on contributed modules. While at the Baltimore Drupal Con I wrote the [Drupal 8 version of the Speedboxes module](https://www.drupal.org/project/speedboxes).

### Exploring and getting familiar with Drupal 8

Any software project that is under active development will be a moving target and as users of this software it is important to stay on top of the latest versions of the software we use. In an effort to do this I submitted a session for Baltimore Drupal Con. My session was about exploring and evaluating Drupal 8 by [rearchitecting, in Drupal 8, a Custom Learning Management System](https://youtu.be/en-nC4ZjdXo) we had built for New Perspectives Online. By doing this session I was able to both get more experience with a new product without having to learn on a client project and also share those experiences with others in the Drupal Community.

Contribution isn't always about code. Contribution is possible regardless of skillset. Everything including bug reports, documentation, design, code, or even just attending Drupal Con is a worthwhile contribution.
