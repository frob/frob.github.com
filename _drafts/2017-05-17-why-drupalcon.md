Software is best when the project comes first. When the project is open source software, the project is built by a community. Drupal has long been the best at what it does. It is the best and most flexible general purpose Content Management System currently on the market --Open Source or not. We use Drupal to build custom solutions for our clients. Using Drupal allows us to provide a cost effective and flexible platform for our clients. Contributing to Drupal allows us to ensure it remains the best and most flexible general purpose Content Management System. Contributing to Drupal is the job of the Drupal Community.

## What is Drupal Con?

Drupal Con is a conference where the Drupal Community can meet each other and exchange information in real life. Historically, the North American Drupal Con will bounce around the Continental US, but Drupal Con also happens in Europe, Asia, and South America.

## Why go to Drupal Con?

At its core Drupal Con is a technology conference, so a big part of going to Drupal Con is keeping up with the current trends in technology. Not just in the Drupal Project but also within the php language space and technology as a whole.

### Keeping up with Technology

Drupal created many powerful tools to help support Drupal Development. With the release of Drupal 8, many of those powerful tools have been replaced by their best-in-class equivalents from the php development community. Some of this can be leaned from blog posts online, or from local dugs (Drupal User Groups), and questions can be asked through IRC, but sometimes it's easier to get a full download by being fully immersed for a few days.

### Open Source Contribution

A large part of getting together is also working together. Much of the work on an open source project happens remotely but at Drupal Con we have the remarkable ability to be in the same room. This allows for many opportunities for collaboration. There are code sprints that go on all week with Friday being reserved as a sprint day. There are no sessions or talks on Friday, leaving the whole day for contribution.

The way this works is they have one or more rooms with round tables, generally the tables will be organized into topics: migrations, twig, install-system, etc. This is also a good place to work on contributed modules. While at the Baltimore Drupal Con I wrote the Drupal 8 version of the Speedboxes module.

### Exploring and getting familiar with Drupal 8

Any software project that is under active development will be a moving target and as users of this software it is important to stay on top of the latest versions of the software we use. In an effort to do this I put in a session at Baltimore Drupal Con. My session was about exploring and evaluating Drupal 8 by rearchitecting a Custom Learning Management System we built for New Perspectives Online in Drupal 8. By doing this session I was able to both get more experience with a new product without having to learn on a client project and also share those experiences with others in the Drupal Community. Contribution isn't always about code.
