Message from Dale:

> In general, I would rank the initial three seasons of ST: TOS in the following way: Season 2, Season 1, and Season 3.  Season 1 has some wonderfully written episodes based on intriguing scenarios, but Season 2 is where the cast was really "owning" their characters. Season 3 has some good episodes, but got pretty silly at times. My favorite episodes are The Doomsday Machine (feels like a mini action movie), City on the Edge of Forever, The Enterprise Incident, Amok Time, Mirror Mirror, Balance of Terror, Devil in the Dark, Arena, Journey to Babel, Space Seed, The Tholian Web, A Piece of the Action, and The Trouble with Tribbles. Tribbles is known as "the funny episode" but it's probably more amusing after you've gotten to know the characters more.
