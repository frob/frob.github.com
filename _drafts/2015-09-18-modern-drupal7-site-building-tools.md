## Why build a site with Drupal 7

Drupal8 is nearly out and it might seem as though Drupal 7 has lost its steam. However, Drupal 7 is still a very effective contender. The module ecosystem for Drupal 7 is mature and, specifically for site builders, it is a very exciting time for Drupal.

# The Modules

I know, I know, many of these modules are not new and this isn't a list of everything someone will need to build a site; this is a list of modules that allow site builders and someone with some front-end skill to build complicated sites with little to no custom module code.

[Title](https://www.drupal.org/project/title)
[Bean](https://www.drupal.org/project/bean)

To install these modules just type:
```bash
drush dl context views eva block_class field_formatter_class fences elements viewfield entity_view_mode node_class ds skinr less bootstrap bootstrap_library jquery_update ember ember_support menu_attributes field_group speedboxes title bean
```

```bash drusn en context views eva block_class field_formatter_class fences elements viewfield entity_view_mode node_class ds skinr less bootstrap bootstrap_library jquery_update ember ember_support menu_attributes field_group speedboxes title bean
```
If you do not what to have to confirm over and over again, then you will probably want to pass the ```-y``` flag to the drush command.
