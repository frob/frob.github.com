Today I wanted to make some hard boiled eggs. I went to lookup how long to boild them and decided I was instead going to see if there was a better way to get hard cooked eggs than boiling.
I went to youtube and found an old clip from Alton Brown's Good Eats where he steamed his eggs for 12 minutes. Next I found another video about steaming eggs for 9 mintues for soft-hard eggs from Chef Jon's Food Wishes.com.
So I tried it, I needed 6 hard eggs. So I steamed 7 eggs with the timer set for 9 and 12 min. At 9 minutes I pulled one egg out and cooled it off per Chef Jon's instructions and it was perfectly cooked at soft-hard --sinse I wanted my eggs hard and not soft hard I left the rest in for the full 12 minutes.

We live in a new time where anyone can find any information online they want. 
When much of that information is also not very good. 
When anyone can have an online mentor which they never meet in real life.

Story about fencing books.
Story about bad advice and purpossfully bad advise (drilling your iphone or putting it in the microwave)

How does this affect education.
