A company culter interview question at Clarity Innovations is Star Trek or Star Wars. Until recently I have been mostly Star Wars, but having grown up watching The Next Generation I am very much also a Star Trek fan.

I requested input from some fellows at Clarity about the best order to watch TOS.

Message from Dale:

> In general, I would rank the initial three seasons of ST: TOS in the following way: Season 2, Season 1, and Season 3.  Season 1 has some wonderfully written episodes based on intriguing scenarios, but Season 2 is where the cast was really "owning" their characters. Season 3 has some good episodes, but got pretty silly at times.

Followed by a list of episodes.

## This is the agreed uppon order

- The Doomsday Machine (s02e06)
- City on the Edge of Forever (s01e28)
- The Enterprise Incident (s03e02)
- Amok Time (s02e01)
- Mirror Mirror (s02e04)
- Balance of Terror (s01e14)
- Devil in the Dark (s01e25)
- Arena (s01e18)
- Journey to Babel (s02e10)
- Space Seed (s01e22)
- The Tholian Web (s03e09)
- A Piece of the Action (s02e17)
- The Trouble with Tribbles (s02e15)
